# Introduction
Contests over mates can be very costly.

Alternative reproductive strategies (ART's) can develop as a way to minimise these costs.
This package implements an individual based model (sometimes called an agent based model),
that explores how and why these ART's emerge in a species x, which has non overlapping
generations.


## Usage and installation
You can install this package with devtools.

```{r}
if(!require(devtools)) install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("johnwilshire/contest")
```
# Implementation
This package is built with  Rcpp.

## TODO
